## Introduction

JavaScript closures are a fundamental concept that every developer should understand. They are a powerful feature that allows for more flexible and expressive code.

## What is a Closure?

A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the scope of the outer function, and the global scope. This means that a closure can remember and access variables and arguments of its outer function even after the function has finished executing.

## Example of a Closure

```javascript
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
    return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
        console.log('Outer Variable: ' + outerVariable);
        console.log('Inner Variable: ' + innerVariable);
    };
}

const newFunction = outerFunction('outside');
newFunction('inside');
```

In this example, `innerFunction` is a closure. It has access to the `outerVariable` from `outerFunction` even after `outerFunction` has executed.

## Why Use Closures?

Closures are useful because they enable:

1. **Data Privacy**: By using closures, you can create private variables that cannot be accessed from outside the function.
2. **Function Factories**: You can use closures to create functions with preset variables.
3. **Event Handlers**: Closures are often used in event handlers to maintain state between function calls.

## Conclusion

Closures are a powerful feature of JavaScript that can help you write more efficient and maintainable code. Understanding how they work and when to use them is essential for any JavaScript developer.
